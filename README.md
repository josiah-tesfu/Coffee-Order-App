# Café connect

# 'add café items to order' application

This application will serve as the user interface side of a coffee shop order system. Users will be
able to add items from a coffee shop to an order.

*Additional features will include*:
- expanding items in the order
- removing items from the order
- editing items in the order. 

Potential users of this application are anyone who would like to order coffee from their local coffee shop.
This application might be later expanded as a portal to allow users to order from a selection of coffee
shops in their local area, with implementation varying based on each coffee shop's menu/ preferences.

I'm a big coffee guy, so this application is of specific interest to me. I also love going to new smaller
coffee shops and would be interested in an online order system for these that might otherwise be available
for larger cafés like Starbucks or Tim Hortons.
